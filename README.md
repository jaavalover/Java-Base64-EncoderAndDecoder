# Java-Base64-EncoderAndDecoder
Very simple Base64 encoding and decoding tool written in Java.

Note: This project was created for educational purposes, if anyone really wants to encode or decode Base64 just visit a website like https://www.base64decode.org/en/ because it works faster and easier.
Really the only advantage is that it works offline :P
